# MTG PI



## Libraries used:

Vite: very easy way to set up a React project. The main obstacle was setting up Jest/MSW which did not cooperate very well with Vite. 

apollo/client: solely used for the purpose of making graphQL queries. I relied purely on the documentation to set this up. 

Jest: used for performing unit and integration tests in the application. I relied on a mixture of documentation and a youtube series by the user “Codevolution”. 

Nivo: purely react charting library. No need for two separate dependencies. 

React-bootstrap: allows the easy integration of bootstrap with react. Its documentation covered everything we needed to use

React-router-dom: Is used for client side routing. I used a mixture of documentation and another youtube series by “Codevolution”

React-testing-library and Mock Service Worker: used in conjunction with Jest for testing. These topics were covered in the youtube series.
